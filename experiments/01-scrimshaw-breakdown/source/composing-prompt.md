You are composing music in the Scrimshaw score format: plain text that a web page plays through a Web Audio synthesizer, in the style of early-1990s adventure game soundtracks. Your score will be pasted into an editor and played straight away, so follow these rules exactly. The most common mistake is a bar with the wrong number of steps, so count every bar.

## What to reply with

One complete score in a single fenced code block, followed by no more than a couple of sentences about it. Only use the keywords, instruments, chord names and symbols described here. If I paste back error messages from the editor, fix the lines they point to and reply with the whole corrected score.

## Layout

A score is read from top to bottom, one statement per line, in this order:

1. Settings for the whole song
2. `voice` lines, declaring each part and its instrument
3. `pattern` blocks: a pattern line followed by its music lines
4. `play` and `loop` lines: the arrangement (always last)

A `#` at the start of a word begins a comment that runs to the end of the line. `F#4` is still a note because its `#` is inside a word. Blank lines are ignored.

## Settings

```
title    The Name of the Piece
composer Your Name   # optional
about    One or two sentences. The first sentence is shown as a caption while it plays.
tempo    100         # beats per minute, 20 to 400 (default 120)
beats    4           # beats per bar, 1 to 16 (default 4)
steps    4           # steps per beat, 1 to 12 (default 4)
swing    0.12        # delays every other step, 0 to 0.75 (default 0)
reverb   0.3         # overall reverb, 0 to 1 (default 0.3)
```

A step is the smallest unit of rhythm. Every bar holds exactly beats × steps steps:

- `beats 4` `steps 4`: 4/4 in sixteenth notes, 16 steps per bar
- `beats 4` `steps 2`: 4/4 in eighth notes, 8 steps per bar
- `beats 3` `steps 2`: a 3/4 waltz in eighths, 6 steps per bar
- `beats 2` `steps 3`: a 6/8 jig, 6 steps per bar (tempo counts dotted quarters)
- `beats 4` `steps 3`: a 12/8 shuffle, 12 steps per bar

Swing only works when steps is even. 0.1 to 0.15 is a light lilt; 0.33 gives a triplet shuffle.

## Voices

```
voice NAME INSTRUMENT key=value key=value ...
```

Names use letters, digits and underscores, and each is declared once. Every voice used in a pattern must be declared. There is no drum kit instrument: give each drum sound its own voice (one for kick, one for snare, one for hat and so on).

Voice options:

- `vol=0.8` level, 0 to 2 (default 0.8)
- `pan=-0.3` stereo position, -1 left to 1 right (default 0)
- `rev=0.4` reverb send, 0 to 1
- `oct=-1` shift by whole octaves
- `trans=3` shift by semitones
- `gate=0.5` sound each note for this fraction of its written length, 0.05 to 1 (default 1). 0.4 to 0.6 gives short, detached chords
- `center=A4` the pitch that chord names are voiced around (default D4)
- `glide=0.1` slide time in seconds for `~` notes (default 0.07)
- `bright=1.5` tone brightness, 0.1 to 4 (default 1)
- `att=0.05` attack time in seconds
- `rel=0.5` release time in seconds

Melodic instruments:

- Mallets and bells: steeldrum marimba vibes celesta glock xylophone musicbox bell
- Keyboards: organ pipe harpsichord
- Strings: strings pizz fiddle harp guitar banjo upright
- Winds and brass: flute clarinet oboe bassoon accordion trumpet brass horn tuba
- Voices and pads: choir voices pad
- Bass and timpani: fretless synbass timpani
- Plain synths: chip sine square saw triangle

Drum instruments, one sound per voice:

- Kit: kick snare rim hat ohat ride crash clap
- Hand percussion: conga tumba bongo bongolo timbale bodhran shaker tamb clave block cowbell guiro tri
- Toms and effects: tomlo tommid tomhi gong thunder surf

Some of these names are short: pipe is a pipe organ, pizz is pizzicato strings, upright is an upright bass, chip is a square-wave game console lead, ohat is an open hi-hat, tamb is a tambourine, tri is a triangle, thunder is a long thunder roll and surf is a wave breaking on a beach (both last several seconds).

## Patterns

```
pattern NAME
VOICE | bar | bar | bar | bar |
VOICE | bar | bar | bar | bar |
```

Pattern names use letters, digits and underscores, like `A`, `B2` or `intro`. A music line is a voice name followed by bars separated by `|`. There must be a `|` straight after the voice name; the closing `|` is optional. A bar can't be empty: write `_` for a silent bar.

- A voice can have several lines in one pattern; they join end to end. Keep lines to about four bars.
- Voices left out of a pattern are silent during it.
- A pattern lasts as long as its longest voice, so give every voice in it the same number of bars.
- `pattern A2 from A` starts as a copy of pattern A. A voice written in A2 replaces that voice's whole part from A; the other voices carry over unchanged.
- `mute NAME` inside a pattern silences that voice (handy after `from`).
- A `tempo`, `beats`, `steps` or `swing` line inside a pattern changes only that pattern. These can also go on the pattern line: `pattern slow tempo=80 swing=0`

## Melodic bars

A melodic bar is a row of tokens separated by spaces. Each token takes up a number of steps, and together they must add up to exactly beats × steps.

- Note: a letter A to G, an optional accidental (`#` `##` `b` `bb`), then an octave 0 to 8. `C4` is middle C, `B3` is just below it, `A4` is 440 Hz. Examples: `D5` `F#4` `Bb3`. A note lasts one step.
- Each dash after a note adds a step: `D5---` lasts four steps.
- Rest: each `.` is one step of silence, and dashes after a dot add more rest: `.` is 1 step, `....` is 4, `.---` is 4, `.-------` is 8.
- A token of dashes on its own (`-` or `---`) keeps the previous note sounding for that many more steps. Use it to tie a note across a bar line.
- Notes struck together are joined with `+` and no spaces: `C4+E4+G4`. Dashes go at the end: `C4+E4+G4---`
- A chord name in square brackets, voiced close to the voice's `center`: `[Dm]` `[G7]` `[Bbmaj7]`. A slash adds a bass note below: `[C/E]` `[D/F#]`. Dashes extend it: `[Dm]---`
- Dynamics: `!` after a note makes it louder, `?` makes it softer. Stack them for more: `D5!!` `A2??`. They go right after the note or after its dashes: `[Dm]?---` or `D5---!`
- Slide: `~` before a note glides into it from that voice's previous note: `~A2--`

Symbols that fill a whole bar, alone between the bar lines:

- `%` repeats the previous bar
- `_` is a silent bar
- `=` holds the note that was sounding at the end of the previous bar through this whole bar

Chord names are a root (A to G, optionally followed by `#` or `b`) then one of these suffixes, or no suffix for a major triad:

m 7 m7 maj7 mmaj7 6 m6 9 m9 maj9 add9 madd9 sus2 sus4 7sus4 dim dim7 m7b5 aug 5 7b9

Examples: `[C]` `[Am]` `[F#m7]` `[Ebmaj7]` `[Dsus4]` `[G7b9]` `[Bdim]` `[Em/G]`

## Drum bars

A voice played by a drum instrument reads one character per step:

- `x` a hit
- `X` an accented hit
- `o` a quiet ghost note
- `.` nothing

Spaces are ignored, so group the characters by beat. With 16 steps per bar: `x... ..x. x... ..x.` With 6 steps per bar: `X.x x.x`. The whole-bar symbols `%` and `_` work in drum lines too. A drum bar still needs exactly beats × steps characters, not counting spaces.

## Arrangement

```
play intro            # patterns played once, in order
loop A A2 B*2 A2+2    # patterns that then repeat forever
```

- `B*2` plays a pattern twice.
- `A+5` or `A-2` transposes a pattern up or down by that many semitones. Drums are not affected. Both can be combined: `A+2*2`
- With no `play` or `loop` line, every pattern loops in the order it was written.
- Like game music, the loop repeats forever, so make the end of the loop lead smoothly back to its beginning.

## Count every bar before you reply

A note or chord counts 1 plus its dashes. A rest counts its dots plus its dashes. A lone dash token counts its dashes. A drum bar counts its characters, ignoring spaces. Worked examples at 16 steps per bar:

```
E5-- G5-- B5- A5 G5 F#5 E5 D5---       3+3+2+1+1+1+1+4 = 16
.- [Em]- .- [Em]- .- [Em]- .- [Em]-    2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 16
A5------- .... D5 E5 F#5! G5!          8+4+1+1+1+1 = 16
x... .... x... x.x.                    16 characters
```

## Composing tips

- Write a short intro that plays once, then a loop of 16 to 48 bars built from two to four patterns, so the music develops before it repeats.
- Typical ranges: bass in octaves 1 and 2, chords and pads centered in octave 4 (`center=E4` or `center=G4`), melodies in octaves 4 to 6.
- Use `pattern X2 from X` to vary a section with a counter-melody or a different drum part without rewriting it.
- Use `%` for repeated bars, especially in drum parts, to keep the score short.
- Balance levels with `vol`: pads and percussion around 0.3 to 0.7, the lead around 0.9 to 1.1.
- Choose a key and a chord progression first, then write the melody over it. The bass usually plays chord roots on the strong beats.

Compose the piece I describe below. If I haven't described one, compose an original piece in a style of your choice.
